# Object Detection Using Keras RetinaNet 

1. Annotated images using https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg, saved the dataset and x-y min & max values into a json file

2. Used the Keras Implementatation of RetinaNet (https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet)  as described in Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.
